            <h3> Coding Challenge 2: Building. Create your own visualisations. </h3>
            <p> 
                Here are two graphs created using https://www.economicsobservatory.com/create

        <section>
                <h3> Coding Challlenge 3: Debating. Use a visualisation in economic/policy commentary </h3>
                <p> 
                    Panel chosen: “The kids aren’t alright: Tackling a legacy of child poverty, bad diets and poor health”
                    Children in the UK face growing educational disparities, health issues, and rising poverty, affecting millions and highlighting a concerning upward trend.

            <figure id="Location6"></figure> 
            <p> 
                Despite fluctuations, the percentage of children in low-income families without disabilities remains persistently high, illustrating the socioeconomic challenges that contribute to educational and health inequalities.

     <!-------- CODING CHALLENGE 4 ------------->

    <section>
            <h3> Coding Challenge 4: Replication. Re-create, then improve, someone else’s chart. </h3>
            <p> 
                This challenge replicates and enhances a graph originally published by Doria's campaign during his 2018 run for Governor of São Paulo (which he won). The graph displays candidates' names, their political parties, and the statement, "Doria leads according to research."
            </p>
       
            <!-- Adding ugly graph png -->
        <img src="PortfolioFig/badgraph_doria.jpg" alt="Bar graph showing Doria leading in 2018 São Paulo governor race" style="width: 300px; height: 600px auto;">
    </section>

    <section>
            <p>
                Here is the image replicated using Vega Lite:
            </p>
        <figure id="Location7"></figure>
    </section>

    <section>
        <p> 
            Here is the improved version:
        </p>
        <figure id="Location8"></figure>
        <p> 
            The misleading graph was corrected by fixing the y-axis to represent actual percentages and removing exaggerated bar heights, properly sorting bars by real values, and using uniform colors. 
        </p>

    <!-------- CODING CHALLENGE 5 ------------->

    <section>
        <h3> Coding Challlenge 6: Scraper. Implement a data scraper of your own </h3>
            <p>
                The website UN NEWS was scraped. Collab notebook <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16QiPyAFo-iWiqq37ZaD73PUoEWTXrD6m?usp=sharing">here</a>.
            </p>

    <figure id="Location9"></figure>
    <p> 
        The UN News website serves as a valuable resource for understanding the key concerns of international policy actors, often reflecting major political and humanitarian issues.
