        The aim of this project is to investigate the relationship between healthcare spending and health outcomes in Brazil. By analyzing data on healthcare expenditures and various health indicators, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that can inform policy decisions and improve the efficiency of healthcare spending in the country. This project utilizes data visualization techniques to present the findings in an accessible and engaging manner.

This suggests that there may be inefficiencies in the healthcare system that need to be addressed to improve health outcomes in the country.

Municipalities with worst performance have received more money to tackle it. To make this comparison more accurate, I will know compare specific spending by UF with some specific indicators that shoudl improve with more spending.
