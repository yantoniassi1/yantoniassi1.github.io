        The aim of this project is to investigate the relationship between healthcare spending and health outcomes in Brazil. By analyzing data on healthcare expenditures and various health indicators, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that can inform policy decisions and improve the efficiency of healthcare spending in the country. This project utilizes data visualization techniques to present the findings in an accessible and engaging manner.
